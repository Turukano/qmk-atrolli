## Alt-Tab

I use a combo on my homerow to alttab to the right and another combo to alttab to the left. These combos have the same keys as my arrow keys, so it feels natural. Both combos trigger a timer, which elapses after 10ms. However, whenever I know that I don't want to browse between multiple tabs but just go back to the previous one, I hit a three-finger-combo, which instantly takes me there without a timer.

## Select line

Incidentally, the same three-finger-combo on the NAV layer selects the current line. I use this a lot.

## Tap dances

I try to scale down on tap dances, as they don't feel natural to me. I only put in rarely used symbols, such as TILDE or PARAGRAPH. Instead I use combos or I interrupt holds (I discovered this recently and I like it), e.g. hold c to copy, hold v to paste, hold vowel to give it an accent (Ã©), etc. 

## Navigation

I took the NAV layer from someone else, it is awesome, you should check it out.
