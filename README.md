Alt-Tab

I use a combo on my homerow to alttab to the right and another combo to alttab to the left. These combos have the same keys as my arrow keys, so it feels natural. Both combos trigger a timer, which elapses after 10ms. However, whenever I know that I don't want to browse between multiple tabs but just go back to the previous one, I hit a three-finger-combo, which instantly takes me there without a timer.
